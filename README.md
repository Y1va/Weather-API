# Challenge 06 - Weather Dashboard


## Description

For this challenge I had to create a weather dashboard that utilises server side APIs. The API that was used for this challenge was the 5 day / 3 hour weather API from OpenWeather. This code defines a weather application that allows users to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast of a city. It uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and also utilises dayjs library for date formatting.

It also includes functionality for handling search history and storing that history into the local storage. The code has been commented to explain its functionality.
